# [ECAM](http://ecam.hol.es/)

ECAM web tool is a web application developed by [ICRA](http://icra.cat), 
[IWA](http://www.iwa-network.org) and GIZ under the WaCCliM project, and Cobalt Water.

## Development status
Currently we are developing the version 2.0.

## Using ecam online
To use ecam, just go to [ecam.hol.es](http://ecam.hol.es/) (version 1.0 there)

## Installation (offline use)
Ecam can be also used offline (it runs faster).
You need to install it inside a XAMPP (or a similar web server program).
To use ecam offline, download the package from github, and move it to the "htdocs" folder in XAMPP (or analog folder in other programs).
Then, start XAMPP and go to http://localhost/ecam in your web browser.
