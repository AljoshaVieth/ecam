## Using ecam online
To use ecam, just go to [wacclim.org/ecam](http://wacclim.org/ecam)

## Installation (offline use)
Ecam can be also used offline (it runs faster).
You need to place this folder inside a XAMPP (or similar php server software).
To use ecam offline, download the package from github, and move it to the "htdocs" folder in XAMPP (or analog folder in other programs).
Then, start XAMPP apache service, open your browser and go to http://localhost/ecam.
