Are you producing biogas? [Y/N] (Level1)
	if N
	Do not ask the question of biogas valorization neither the followings inputs:
	•	wwt2 – Biogas production 
	•	wwt12 - % methane in biogas 
	•	wwt3 – Biogas valorized
	•	wwt11- Energy production from biogas valorization
	Hide the following calculated variables:
	•	c_wwt50 – biogas flared
	•	c_ww50 – biogas flared
	•	c_wwt53 – Energy content in valorized biogas

	if Y
	Shown the following inputs and calculated variables
	•	wwt2 – Biogas production
	•	c_wwt50 – biogas flared
	•	c_ww50 – biogas flared (work under Level 1 if biogas valorization is N; if biogas valorization is Y then = 0)

	Ask for biogas valorization [Y/N] (Level 1) if N do not ask or hide
	•	wwt3 – Biogas valorized [if no then = 0]
	•	c_wwt53 – Energy content in valorized biogas
	•	wwt11- Energy production from biogas valorization
	•	wwt12 - % methane in biogas






Are you producing electrical energy? [Y/N](Level2)
	•	wsg1 – water related electricity produced
	•	wsg2 - water related electricity sold to the grid
	•	wsg3 – Non-water related electricity produced
	•	wsg4 – Non-water related electricity sold to the grid
	•	wsa3 – Electric energy produced from turbines
	•	wwg1 - water related electricity produced 
	•	wwg2 – water related electricity sold to the grid
	•	wwg3 – Non-water related electricity production
	•	wwg4 – Non-water related electricity sold to the grid
	•	wwd4 – Energy recovered during the wastewater discharge
Do you have fuel engines? [Y/N](Level 1)
	•	ww23 – Monthly fuel consumption
	•	ww11 – Vol fuel consumed
	•	ws16 – Monthly fuel consumed
	•	ws9 – Fuel consumed
Are you using truck to convey sludge to the disposal site? [Y/N] (Level 1)
	•	ww24 – Number of trips to sludge disposal per week
	•	ww9 – Distance to sludge disposal site
Is your topography flat? [Y/N] (Level 2)
	•	wsd10 – Minimum pressure to be supplied at the distribution points
	•	wsd11 – highest node elevation
	•	wsd12 – lowest node elevation
	•	wsd13 - Average nodes elevation
	•	wsd14 – water table elevation node
	All calculated variables which are using any of those inputs should be hidden when the answer of the related question is NO
