1. PIs should have only 1 decimal
2. Some formulas should not be working with ‘0’ values (See Xls list attached).
3. New variable: Average sewage production per pers per day prior to dilution from infiltration or inflow”, unit = L/pers/day;
4. Biogas flared estimated:

wwd_KPI_nrg_per_m3	    If energy equals 0 then formula = 0 (gravity feed)
