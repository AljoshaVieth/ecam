	- The level 1 is the easy overview, based on estimated / average data  that utility leaders typically have in their head. We should rename this level “Bird’s eye view”. The target audience is the utility leader, the regional water authority.
	- If the utility decides to move to the detailed assessment (level 2 and 3 should be renamed “detailed assessment 1” and “detailed assessment 2”), the user needs to get into their data management system to collect the right data. The target audience is the utility technical staff.
	- Once the detailed assessment data is filled in, the Level 1 “bird’s eye view” indicators  may be updated with the same approach as level 3 to level 2. The best approach I see to that is to have an IF statement in the calculated variables of Level 1: they would either calculate quantities from the average inputs of level 1 or take the quantities from level 2. 
	- The distinction between service level indicators and performance indicators

"wwt14" is used in 
	wtE3	  = function(){return this.wwt9/this.wwt14||0}
	wtE5	  = function(){return this.wwt2/this.wwt14||0}

c_wwt54 is used in
