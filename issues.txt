-> ww12 es Amount of recovered biogas
-> ww13 es Annual per capita protein consumption
-> ww14 es una variable que té protein i Bod amb default value 40
-> wwt4 (fuel type) ara no existeix if wwt4= diesel then iS1=iS1-1                                            
-> wwt7 ara no existeix - geographic location protein consumption rate for variable calc. 
-> c_ws51 he tret factor comú
-> c_ww57 he tret factor comú
-> c_ww56 hi ha una k a la formula i sobra el 43
-> c_ww58 cal multiplicar per 0.84 despres del 0.25
-> he canviat c_wwt50_n per c_wwt60_n per no confondre amb c_wwt50
-> he canviat c_wwt51_n per c_wwt61_n per no confondre amb c_wwt51
-> c_wwt51_n es el mateix que c_wwt53, he eliminat la de level 3

-> cal afegir tecnologia L3 a tractaments
