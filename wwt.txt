# WASTEWATER TREATMENT

## NORMAL ASSESSMENT (STAGE LEVEL)
	1. FILTERS (Yes/No)
		- Are you producing biogas?
		- Are you valorizing biogas?
		- Do you have fuel engines?
																										
	2. INPUTS	& CALCULATED VARIABLES
		- Volume of treated wastewater
		- Energy consumed from the grid
		- Fuel consumed
		- Total Nitrogen load in effluent discharged to water body
		- Biogas produced
		- Biogas flared
		- Biogas valorized

	3. OUTPUTS (GHG & NRG & SL)
		- GHG from electricity
		- GHG from CH4 in WWTP
		- GHG from fuel
		- GHG from N2O emission from WWT process
		- GHG from discharge to water body, N2O from WWTP effluent discharge, especifically to water body																							
		- GHG from Biogas flared
		- Total GHG WW Treatment
		- Treated wastewater per person per day

## ADVANCED ASSESSMENT (SUBSTAGE LEVEL)
	1. FILTERS (Yes/No)
		- Are you interested in evaluating pumping efficiency?
		- Do you want to evaluate treatment performance?
		- Do you want to evaluate digester efficiency?
																										
	2. INPUTS	& CALCULATED VARIABLES
		2.1 GENERAL INPUTS							
			- Volume of treated wastewater
			- Treatment capacity
			- Total energy consumed from the grid for WWTP
		2.2 PUMPING		
			- Volume of wastewater pumped in WWTP
			- Energy consumed from the grid for pumping
			- Pump head
		2.3 TREATMENT 							
			- Influent BOD5 load
			- Effluent BOD5 load
			- Percent of complaince tests in compliance
			- BOD5 mass removed
		2.4 SLUDGE
			- Sludge produced in WWTPs
			- Dry weight in sludge produced
			- Sludge storage time
			- Sludge volume stored
			- Dry sludge volume disposed of
			- Sludge type disposed of
			- Disposal type
