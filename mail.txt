Add the following inputs, equations and outputs to be also included for pump efficiency evaluation :

new wsa_nrg_Q_pmp Measured pump flow   L/s
New wsa_nrg_p_volt Measured pump voltage V
New wsa_nrg_p_amps Measured pump current Amp
New wsa_nrg_p_wp Calculated water power  kW
new wsa_nrg_p_emeff Electromechanical efficiency of existing pump %

Calc water power (wsa_nrg_p_wp) = wsa_nrg_Q_pmp *wsa_pmp_head*9.81*10^3*0.001/1000

wsa_nrg_p_emeff  = wsa_nrg_p_wp /(( wsa_nrg_p_volt * wsa_nrg_p_amps)*1.64/1000)*100

new (input) wsa_nrg_exp_emeff Expected electromechanical efficiency of new pump   % C

new (calculated) wsa_nrg_sta_nrg_newp Standarized energy consumption of new pump kWh/m3/100m C
0.2725/wsa_nrg_exp_emeff

new (calculated) wsa_nrg_cons_newp Energy consumption w/expected new pump efficiency kWh C
wsa_vol_pump * wsa_nrg_sta_nrg_newp / 100 * wsa_pmp_head

new (calculated) wsa_nrg_est_sav Estimated electricity savings kWh/assessment C
wsa_KPI_nrg_per_m3 -  wsa_nrg_cons_newp

new (calculated) wsa_nrg_ghg_red Estimated GHG reduction per assessment period % C
Conv factor * wsa_nrg_est_sav
