COLLECTION

Add the following inputs for is water efficiency is selected, after wet weater flow and dry weather flow input:
new
wwc_wef_wwd
number of rain days during assessment period
 

Missing 
Infiltration/inflow


m3

Infiltration/inflow m3 = no. of rain days during assessment period * wwc_wet_flow

This can be added to only global but after everything else.  See discussion below.

Hi José,

Uncollected wastewater:
Formula for CH4 uncollected wastewater:
(ww_resi_pop - ww_conn_pop) * wwc_bod_pday/1000 * Days * ct_ch4_ef * ct_ch4_eq
 
Formula for N2O from uncollected wastewater:
(ww_resi_pop - ww_conn_pop) * wwc_prot_con * Years * ct_fra_np * ct_fac_nc * ct_fac_ic * ct_ef_eff * ct_n2o_co * ct_n2o_eq
 
I haven’t looked too much into the details, but they follow the same logic as “untreated wastewater”. We might need to revise is the EF (ct_ch4_ef), but should be ok for now.
 
 
Onsite treatment:
New input: Population with onsite treatment (ww_pop_onsite)
 
Formula for CH4 from  onsite treatment:
(ww_onsite_pop) * wwc_bod_pday/1000 * Days * ct_ch4_ef_sep * ct_ch4_eq
ct_ch4_ef_sep for Septic systems: 0.3
 
 
Formula for N2O from onsite treatment:
I don´t know… would need to look at IPCC…  could adapt from untreated water (like below), but have no idea if it is adequate.  
(ww_onsite_pop) * wwc_prot_con * Years * ct_fra_np * ct_fac_nc * ct_fac_ic * ct_ef_eff * ct_n2o_co * ct_n2o_eq
 
 
Best, 
Andrés
